# Pomoria Digital Foundry
Welcome to Pomoria Digital Foundry. As a nascent technology venture, we are taking our first steps into a world where innovation and practical application meet.

## Mission
At Pomoria, we aim to explore and utilize machine learning in various fields. Our focus is on combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with machine learning techniques to create tools that support and improve human creative and cognitive processes. With every project, we seek to expand our knowledge and skills in this rapidly advancing area.

## Vision
Our vision is to develop a suite of intelligent tools that seamlessly integrate with human thought processes, augmenting creativity and efficiency. We strive to create an ecosystem where technology and human intellect coexist in harmony, leading to breakthroughs in various crafts and disciplines.

## Values
- **LLM Usage** Utilizing LLMs to enhance the quality and depth of user experiences and internal communication.
- **Practical ML Applications** Developing applied machine learning projects that provide tangible benefits during user interaction.
- **Innovative Experiences** Crafting 'Magic Moments' where technology transcends expectations, offering users a glimpse into the future of human-AI collaboration.
- **Multi Sensory Experiences** Creating experiences that engage multiple senses, including sight, sound, and touch.
- **Multi Modal Experiences**  Multimodal AI represents a novel approach to artificial intelligence that combines different types of data, such as images, text, speech, and numerical information. By integrating multiple intelligence processing algorithms, it aims to enhance performance levels.

## Team
**Carlos**: Carlos has previous startup experience. He is a full-stack developer with a background in Ruby on Rails web development. He was previously a Product Manager and CTO. He is currently interested in LLMs, Diffusion Models, and exploring how people interact with LLMs.
